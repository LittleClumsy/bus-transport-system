# Home Component

The `Home` component fetches user data from an API endpoint using a custom Axios instance and displays it in a list. It uses hooks to manage state and side effects.

## Overview

This component makes an HTTP GET request to fetch user data and displays each user's ID and email in a styled `Box` component from Material-UI. The loading state is managed to provide user feedback while the data is being fetched.
